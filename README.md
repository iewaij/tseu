# Trading Strategies on the European Stock Market

## Data Source

### pandas-datareader 

`pandas_datareader` is a python package to download data from multiple sources, e.g. yahoo finance, Eurostat and OECD. As the package's name suggests, the data will be directly pulled into a pandas dataframe. The documentation for this package is limited, therefore you might need use `shift + tab` in jupyter notebooks or dig into [the source code](https://github.com/pydata/pandas-datareader) to understand the available parameters.

To install `pandas_datareader`: 

```
pip install pandas_datareader
```

The following code pulls BMW historical (split and dividend) adjusted price between 1/1/2001 and 1/2/2021 from yahoo finance:

```python
import pandas_datareader as pdr
pdr.get_data_yahoo("BMW.DE", start="2001-01-01", end="2021-02-01")
```

By specifying `adjust_price=True`, `pandas_datareader` adjusts all prices (`Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`) based on `Adj Close` price. It also adds `Adj_Ratio` column and drops `Adj Close`.

```python
pdr.get_data_yahoo("BMW.DE", start="2001-01-01", end="2021-02-01", adjust_price=True)
```

You may also download multiple stock data at the same time, though you need some pandas kung-fu to transform the shape of the dataframe:

```python
data = pdr.get_data_yahoo(["ADS.DE", "BMW.DE"], start="2001-01-01", end="2021-02-01", adjust_price=True)
df = data.stack(level=1).reset_index(level=1)
```

Making the same request repeatedly can use a lot of bandwidth, slow down your code and may result in your IP being banned. `pandas-datareader` allows you to cache queries into a `sqlite` database using `requests_cache`. First make sure you have installed `requests_cache`:

```
pip install requests_cache
```

The following function can download and cache your requests for BMW historical price between 1/1/2001 and today from yahoo finance. `web.DataReader()` exposes limited parameters, therefore we can only get adjusted closing price:

```python
from datetime import timedelta, date
import pandas_datareader.data as web
import requests_cache

def get_data(symbols, start="1/1/2001", end=date.today()):
    session = requests_cache.CachedSession(
        cache_name="cache", backend="sqlite", expire_after=timedelta(days=1)
    )
    data = web.DataReader(symbols, "yahoo", start, end, session=session)
    return data

get_data("BMW.DE")
```

### WRDS
Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) is online platform that provides access to analytics and historical financial and accounting data for corporations and banks, historical economic data, and tutorials on how to access them. We will count on WRDS to pull security price, fundamental, and analyst data.

After finishing [initial setup](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/programming-wrds/programming-python/python-from-your-computer/#initial-setup-the-pgpass-file), you can initialize a new connection by using the following code:

```python
db = wrds.Connection(wrds_username='WRDS_USERNAME')
```

You can use this connection object (`db`) to query WRDS database. You can find company specific code using [WRDS company code lookup](https://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu/wrds/code_search/). Note that the most standard identifiers, such as companiesâ€™ tickers and CUSIPs, tend to change over time. Therefore, using GVKEY (Global Company Key) which is a unique number assigned to each company in the Compustat-Capital IQ database is always prefered. To pull the company information of BMW, you can query against [Compustat Global Daily](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/data-dictionary/comp_global_daily/) library:

```python
db.raw_sql(
    """
    SELECT *
    FROM comp_global_daily.g_company
    WHERE gvkey = '100022';
    """)
```

Or directly pull the table:


The following code queries against the daily prices of BMW since 1/1/2001. Note that the adjusted price is PRICE/AJEXDI and you need to adjust that manually: 

```python
db.raw_sql(
    """
    SELECT datadate, prchd, prcld, prcod, prccd, cshtrd, ajexdi 
    FROM comp_global_daily.g_sec_dprc
    WHERE datadate >= '2001-01-01'::date
    AND gvkey = '100022'
    AND iid = '01W'
    ORDER BY date;
    """,
    date_cols=["datadate"])
```

Always disconnect using `close()` when you exit your Python environment
or complete your data query download step and want to move onto another:

```python
db.close()
```

You can also use `with` statement which automatically closes the connection when the query is finished:

```python
def get_data_wrds():
    with wrds.Connection(wrds_username="WRDS_USERNAME") as db:
        data = db.raw_sql(
            """
            SELECT datadate, prchd, prcld, prcod, prccd, cshtrd, ajexdi 
            FROM comp_global_daily.g_sec_dprc
            WHERE datadate >= '2001-01-01'::date
            AND gvkey = '100022'
            AND iid = '01W'
            ORDER BY date;
            """,
            date_cols=["datadate"],
        )
    return data
```
## Exchange
We will limit our scope to major reference European exchanges. Here are their codes in WRDS:

| exchg |        exchgdesc        |
| :---: | :---------------------: |
|  104  | NYSE Euronext Amsterdam |
|  132  | NYSE Euronext Brussels  |
|  171  |          XETRA          |
|  151  |     Swiss Exchange      |
|  192  |  NYSE Euronext Lisbon   |
|  194  |  London Stock Exchange  |
|  201  |     Bolsa De Madrid     |
|  209  |     Borsa Italiana      |
|  256  |    NASDAQ OMX Nordic    |
|  286  |   NYSE Euronext Paris   |

If you are looking for other exchanges' codes, run the following queries:

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	comp_global_daily.r_ex_codes;
```

To look up companies' listed stock on major European exchanges, run the following querry:

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	comp_global_daily.g_security
WHERE exchg = ANY (ARRAY[104,132, 171, 151, 192, 194, 201, 209, 256, 286]);
```

Global companies like BMW list their shares on multiple exchanges. We want to find the reference listing which also has available data on IBES. To find European company's stock issues which has IBES links, run the following query:

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
	comp_global_daily.g_security
WHERE
	exchg = ANY (ARRAY[104,132, 171, 151, 192, 194, 201, 209, 256, 286])
	AND ibtic IS NOT NULL;
```

Using the query as sub-query, we can find the daily stock prices for companies on major European exchanges.

```sql
SELECT
	datadate,
	security_price.gvkey,
	security_price.iid,
	curcdd,
	prcod,
	prchd,
	prcld,
	prccd,
	cshtrd,
	ajexdi
FROM
	comp_global_daily.g_secd AS security_price,
	(
		SELECT
			gvkey,
			iid
		FROM
			comp_global_daily.g_security
		WHERE
			exchg = ANY (ARRAY [104,132, 171, 151, 192, 194, 201, 209, 256, 286])
			AND ibtic IS NOT NULL) AS security_eu
WHERE
	datadate >= '2001-01-01'::date
	AND security_price.gvkey = security_eu.gvkey
	AND security_price.iid = security_eu.iid
ORDER BY
	datadate;
```
